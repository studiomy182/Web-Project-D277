                    Washington, officially the State of Washington, is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the
                    United States. It is often referred to as Washington state to distinguish it from the national
                    capital, both named for George Washington (the first U.S. president). The state was formed from
                    the western part of the Washington Territory, which was ceded by the British Empire in the Oregon
                    Treaty of 1846. Washington is bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the west, Oregon to the south, Idaho
                    to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia to the north. It was admitted to the
                    Union as the 42nd state in 1889. Olympia is the state capital, while the most populous city is
                    Seattle.</p>

                    Washington is the 18th-largest state, with an area of 71,362 square miles (184,830 km2), and the
                    13th-most populous state, with more than 7.7 million people.[5] The majority of Washington's
                    residents live in the Seattle metropolitan area, the center of transportation, business, and
                    industry on Puget Sound,an inlet of the Pacific Ocean consisting of numerous islands, deep
                    fjords and bays carved out by glaciers. 
                    </p> 
                    <p>The remainder of the state consists of deep temperate
                    rainforests in the west; mountain ranges in the west, center, northeast, and far southeast; and a
                    semi-arid basin region in the east, center, and south, given over to intensive agriculture.
                    Washington is the second most populous state on the West Coast and in the Western United States,
                    after California. Mount Rainier, an active stratovolcano, is the state's highest elevation at 14,411
                    feet (4,392 meters), and is the most topographically prominent mountain in the contiguous U.S.
